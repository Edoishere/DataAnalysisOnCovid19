# Data Analysis on COVID-19

This repository contains a small, self-contained data analysis project developed during my university studies.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis of publicly available COVID-19 data, with a focus on temporal trends and cross-country comparison. The analysis concentrates on Italy and France and aims to highlight similarities and differences in the evolution of cases and deaths over time.

This project is intended as an educational and methodological exercise rather than original epidemiological research.

## Research Questions

* How did COVID-19 cases and deaths evolve over time in Italy and France?
* Are there observable similarities or differences in the timing and magnitude of epidemic waves between the two countries?
* What qualitative insights can be obtained from simple time-series visualizations of public health data?

## Limitations

The analysis is based on aggregated public data, which may be affected by reporting delays, under-reporting, and country-specific testing and reporting policies. As a result, findings should be interpreted qualitatively and not as causal or predictive conclusions.
